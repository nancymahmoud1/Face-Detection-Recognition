## FaceVector

### Overview

**FaceVector** is a modular computer vision system that performs both **face detection** and **face recognition**. Detection is handled in real time using OpenCV‚Äôs Haar cascades, providing a fast and reliable way to localize faces in images.

The recognition component is powered by **machine learning**, using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to extract facial embeddings and classify identities. The system supports RGB and grayscale datasets, trains automatically on first run, and evaluates performance using standard classification metrics and ROC analysis.

> This project demonstrates how classical detection methods and unsupervised learning can be combined into a reproducible pipeline for facial analysis‚Äîbridging traditional vision techniques with lightweight machine learning.

### Model Overview: PCA for Face Recognition

FaceVector uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce high-dimensional image data into a compact set of features known as **eigenfaces**. This enables fast and interpretable face recognition with limited training data.

#### How PCA Works in FaceVector:

1. **Flattening** ‚Äì Each face image is converted into a 1D vector.
2. **Covariance Matrix** ‚Äì A matrix capturing variance between pixel intensities is computed.
3. **Eigen Decomposition** ‚Äì The eigenvectors (eigenfaces) represent directions of maximum variance.
4. **Projection** ‚Äì New face images are projected into this low-dimensional eigenspace.
5. **Classification** ‚Äì Recognition is done by comparing the projected test image with training projections using **Euclidean distance**.

Only **four images per person** are used for training, ensuring the model remains efficient while demonstrating the effectiveness of unsupervised learning.

### How It Works

#### Recognition Pipeline:

* The datasets are split into **train/test folders**, where each person has **4 training images**.
* On the **first run**, the app:

  * Preprocesses the selected dataset (RGB or grayscale)
  * Trains a **PCA model** using the training images
  * Saves the PCA model, embeddings, and labels for future use
* On later runs:

  * If models exist, the app loads them automatically.
  * Users select an image from the test set.
  * The PCA model compares it to trained embeddings and predicts identity using **Euclidean distance**.

#### üîç Detection Pipeline:

* Face detection is powered by OpenCV Haar cascades:

  * `cascadeFaceClassifier.xml`
  * `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
  * `haarcascade_eye.xml`
  * `haarcascade_smile.xml`

> **Identified as:** `person_04`
> **Euclidean Distance:** `0.37`
> **Recognition Mode:** `RGB`

> **Insight:** The system correctly identified the test image by comparing its PCA embedding with the closest match in the training set using Euclidean distance. A distance below 0.5 generally indicates a high-confidence match under the current dataset and preprocessing configuration.

### Performance Evaluation

FaceVector evaluates its PCA-based recognition model using standard classification metrics and ROC curve visualization. The system achieves high accuracy and reliability even with a small training set per identity.

#### ROC Curve

![ROC Curve](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76535f8d-79c4-43f7-a342-e28f459d9aa4)

> The ROC curve above illustrates the model's ability to distinguish between different identities across thresholds.

#### Evaluation Metrics

| Metric      | Value  |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Accuracy    | 0.975  |
| Precision   | 0.9833 |
| Recall      | 0.975  |
| F1 Score    | 0.9733 |
| Specificity | 0.9987 |
| AUC Score   | 0.9231 |

These results confirm the model‚Äôs effectiveness in both correctly identifying known faces and minimizing false positives, even with only four training images per person.
